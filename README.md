# Can Machine Learning help in Solving the Pallet Loading Optimization Problem?
Box Types Dataset
This dataset contains the list of box types used in the experimental evaluation of the paper:

"Can Machine Learning help in Solving the Pallet
Loading Optimization Problem?"

This CSV file includes the geometric and physical characteristics of 50 box types used in the construction of problem instances for training and testing the proposed ML-based approaches.

Columns Description
Box_ID: Identifier of the box type.

Weight: Weight of the box in kilograms (decimal).

Length: Length of the box in millimeters.

Width: Width of the box in millimeters.

Height: Height of the box in millimeters.

Compression: Compression index of the box, representing the maximum vertical load the box can support without damage, when multiplied to the area of the layer.


The compression index is computed based on the box's stacking capacity and is used in the feasibility constraints for vertical loading in the palletization problem.

The full set of 50 box types was provided by a food and beverage logistics company and reflects realistic transportation scenarios.

Instances used in the experiments were generated by selecting subsets of these box types.
